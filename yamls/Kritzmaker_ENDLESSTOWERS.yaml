## ULTRAKILL NOTES
# the only out of logic tech currently is extremely specific skips ("Pipe clip", Freezeframe in 2-3/5-1, Out-Of-Logic 4-2 Completion, 1-1 Rocket Clip)
# said out of logic checks only consist of 1 or 2 each, and require VERY specific circumstances. except 4-2.
#
# After many iterations, most softlocks come from the Violence layer (layer 7/final), but have been thoroughly patched in versions since.
#
# Note 2: ENDLESS TOWERS EXCLUSIVE - i will be playing on VIOLENT difficulty. this makes the game easier in some cases due to reflecting back more attacks.
# Overall, im more used to Violent difficulty rather than Brutal, due to it being newer.
