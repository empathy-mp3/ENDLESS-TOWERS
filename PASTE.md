# the shop

the shop has been very much rebalanced (though is still welcome to rebalance ideas)!
not only am i trying things that are absolutely necessary, i am also experimenting with some changes that sound interesting (within what resources i have)
some items will have an amount of hours listed next to the item, meaning it will take effect that amount of time after it is purchased.
all items are permanent, unless specified otherwise, and all temporary items last for only the current run, unless specified otherwise.
if the run ends before a temporary item takes effect, it will never take effect.
all temporary items increase by 1 cost with each purchase. (and reset in price when the shop resets)
